Usage for pdftex.mk

Project Structure:

  The rules in this document makes the following assumptions:
  - The root-level '.tex' files for each document must be in <project>/src/tex/
  - The LaTeX search path is expanded to include anything under <project>/

Rules:

  %.aux : %.tex
    Generates the '.aux' file for a given document.
    This is necessary for some cross-reference features.
    The '.aux' file will be written to <project>/
    This will also generate '%.log' in <project>/

  %.pdf : %.aux %.tex
    Builds the final PDF for a given document.
    If the corresponding '.aux' file doesn't exist, it gets generated.
    The PDF is written to <project>/
    This will also generate '%.log' in <project>/

Targets:

  clean-pdftex : 
    Deletes all '.pdf', '.aux', and '.log' files in <project>.
  
  help-pdftex : 
    Prints this usage document to console.

Configuration Variables:

  This file defines the following variables intended to be altered by the user:

  PDFTEX:
    The latex-to-pdf compiler.  Defaults to 'pdflatex'.

  PDFTEX_USER_FLAGS:
    Variable for passing extra CLI flags to PDFTEX without undoing this file's setup.
    Defaults empty; override to add flags to the '%.aux' and '%.tex' rules.

  PDFTEX_USER_PATH:
    Variable for adding directories to PDFTEX's search path.
    PDFTEX uses a search path syntax I've never seen before:
      - Entries are separated with ';' (at least on MacOS X)
      - Paths can be relative; '.' will be the cwd when PDFTEX executes.
      - Ending a path with 'dir//' will include all descendants of 'dir'.
      - Ending a path with 'dir/{dir1,...,dirN}' will include all directories 'dir/dir1', ... , 'dir/dirN'.

  PDFTEX_MODE:
    Execution mode for the compiler.
    Unlike most compilers, LaTeX compilers allow some degree of user intervention
    when faced with an error.  pdflatex has the following autonomy modes:
    
    'nonstopmode': (DEFAULT)
      Compiler behaves much like a software compiler;
      it takes default actions in response to errors,
      which probably means your build will fail. 

    'batchmode':
      Like 'nonstopmode', but no console output.
      Results only appear in the '.log' file.
    
    'errorstopmode':
      Compiler stops and asks for user intervention if it encounters an error.
    
    'scrollingmode':
      Compiler only stops for missing files, or keyboard input.
      (not sure what 'keyboard input' means; try it and see :p )

Internal Variables:

  This file defines the following variables for internal use.
  Overriding them will throw out the promised behaviors of this file;
  use this more as a guide for what names are already taken.

  PDFTEX_RELPATH:
    Temporary variable, used to find the directory containing this makefile.

  PDFTEX_DIR:
    Directory containing this makefile.
    Needed to link the classes and packages provided along with this makefile.

  PDFTEX_CLEAN_PATHS:
    Path expressions that tell 'clean-pdftex' which files to remove.
  
  PDFTEX_PATH_LOCAL:
    Search path expression including <project>

  PDFTEX_PATH_TEMPLATE:
    Search path expression including the template packages and classes.

  PDFTEX_PATH_INTERNAL:
    Search path expression; combination of PDFTEX_PATH_LOCAL and PDFTEX_PATH_TEMPLATE

  PDFTEX_PATH:
    Search path for pdftex; combination of PDFTEX_PATH_INTERNAL and PDFTEX_USER_PATH

  PDFTEX_FLAGS_INTERNAL:
    Variable containing internally-defined CLI flags

  PDFTEX_FLAGS:
    Variable containing all CLI flags for calling PDFTEX
